# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI  # 自动化的名称

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push: # push的时候触发
    branches: [ master ]  # 那些分支需要触发

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # 镜像市场

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: checkout # 步骤的名称
        uses: actions/checkout@v2 #软件市场的名称
        with: # 参数
          submodules: true
      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
